## Building WebODF on Windows

The following steps have been tested with the Microsoft C\C++ compilers that are installed with Visual Studio 2010. It may be possible to use MinGW but it has not been verified.

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2010**

   We only need the C\C++ compilers but it is easier to get this by installing VS2010.

   The express version should work http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads#d-2010-express

   It can also be obtained from the Windows 7 SDK but I would recommend the above.

   To avoid issues with CMake, VS2010 SP1 also needs to be downloaded and installed http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691

- **Qt SDK 4.8.5**

   The SDK built with VS 2010 can be downloaded from here http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-win-opensource-4.8.5-vs2010.exe

- **CMake**

   The latest 32-bit installer from here works fine http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12.2-win32-x86.exe

- **Git for Windows**

   Git isn't actually required but rather some Unix programs like cat are used during the build
   You can get this from here https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git

- **Java Runtime 1.7**

   Grab the latest runtime from here http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

### Setup PATH variable

Add the following directories to the PATH variable

CMake path e.g `C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin`

QMake path e.g `C:\QtSDK\bin`

Unix tools path e.g `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin` (Git installer will add this automatically if you select the add Unix tools to PATH option during install)

### Building webodf.js
These commands should be entered from the Visual Studio 2010 command prompt so that msbuild will be added to the PATH

```
git clone https://github.com/kogmbh/WebODF.git webodf
md build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..\webodf
msbuild WebODF.sln
```
